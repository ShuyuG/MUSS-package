Description: In high-dimensional sparse regression with measurement errors in variables, assuming the 
   errors are Normally distributed with mean 0 and errors for each variable have a specific variance, 
   then 'MUSS' can conduct variable selection for such case. 'MUSS' select variables by assuming the 
   regression coefficients have spike and slab priors. 'MUSS' works under EM framework, where indicators 
   of spike-slab priors and the unknown true design matrix are treated as latent variables. To avoid 
   the effect of inappropriate choices of spike and slab scale parameters on variable selection, 
   the final selected regression parameters are obtained following a decreasing sequence of spike 
   parameters. The path of variable selection can be displayed by function from 'MUSS' package.
