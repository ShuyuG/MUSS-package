Package: MUSS
Title: Spike and Slab Variable Selector under Matrix Uncertainty
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Shuyu Guo  guo_sy@outlook.com
Description: In high-dimensional sparse regression with measurement error in variables, assuming 
    the errors are Normally distributed with mean 0 and errors for each variable have a specific 
    variance, then 'MUSS' can conduct variable selection for such case. 'MUSS' selects variables 
    by spike and slab priors for the regression coefficients. It works under EM framework, where 
    the unknown true design matrix and indicators of spike-slab priors are treated as latent variables. 
    To avoid the effect of inappropriate choices of spike and slab scale parameters on variable 
    selection, the final output coefficients are obtained following a decreasing sequence of spike 
    parameters and the path can be displayed by functions from 'MUSS' package.
